description='''"Of the Claims of our Art, its Students, and its Method:

All men who devote their lives to the study of any art, or to any kind of occupation, have before their eyes, as the aim of their efforts, perfection in the thing which they pursue.

But only few attain to the goal of their wishes: there are many architects, but few masters of the art of architecture;

Many students of medicine, but few men like Hippocrates or Galen;

Many mathematicians, but few proficients like Archimedes;

Many poets, but few worthy to rank with Homer.

Yet, even men who have nothing more than a respectable knowledge of their calling, are capable of being useful to society.

Among those who devote themselves to the transmutation of metals,

however, there can be no such thing as mediocrity of attainment.

A person who studies this Art, must have either everything or nothing.

An Alchemist who knows only half their craft, reaps nothing but disappointment

and a waste of time and money; moreover, they lay themselves open to the mockery

of those who despise our Art. Those, indeed, who succeed in reaching the goal

of the Magistery, have not only infinite riches, but the means of continued

life and health.


Hence, it is the most popular of all pursuits."'''
